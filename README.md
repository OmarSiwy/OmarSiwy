## Programming Languages

 
 ## Who am I?
 ```C++
template <typename DerivedPerson>
class WhoAmI {
public:
	void PrintDetails() {
		printf("Name: %s\n Education: %s\n, Hobbies: %s\n",
		static_cast<DerivedPerson*>(this)->Name,
		static_cast<Derived*>(this)->CurrentEducation,
		static_cast<Derived*>(this)->Location;
		static_cast<Derived*>(this)->CurrentJob); // COMPILATION ERROR: NO CURRENT JOB
	}
}

class Omar : public WhoAmI<Omar> {
public:
	static const char* Name = "Omar El-Sawy";
	static const char* CurrentEducation = "University of Waterloo";
	static const char* Location = "Waterloo City";
}
 ```
 
## Current Works
 * I'm currently working on ðŸ”­ building **Mobile Apps using Flutter** and working up on polishing my skills ðŸŒ± in **Competitive Programming**.
